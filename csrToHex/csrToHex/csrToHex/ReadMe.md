# csrToHex
A very simple program to convert a csr specific binary (.img) to intel hex format

## Notes
* Only uses direct addressing so max address is 0xffff
* Built in windows so probably requires rebuilding in linux if you want to do that

## How to run
./csrToHex.exe [inputFile].img [outputfile].hex
